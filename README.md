# Paperless-ngx

Paperless-ngx is a document management system that transforms your physical documents into a searchable online archive so you can keep, well, _less paper_.

Paperless-ngx forked from [paperless-ng](https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng) to continue the great work and distribute responsibility of supporting and advancing the project among a team of people. [Consider joining us!](#community-support) Discussion of this transition can be found in issues
[#1599](https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng/issues/1599) and [#1632](https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng/issues/1632).

A demo is available at [demo.paperless-ngx.com](https://demo.paperless-ngx.com) using login `demo` / `demo`. _Note: demo content is reset frequently and confidential information should not be uploaded._

# Getting started

The easiest way to deploy paperless is docker-compose. The files in the [`/docker/compose` directory](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/tree/main/docker/compose) are configured to pull the image from Github Packages.

If you'd like to jump right in, you can configure a docker-compose environment with our install script:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/main/install-paperless-ngx.sh)"
```

Alternatively, you can install the dependencies and setup apache and a database server yourself. The [documentation](https://paperless-ngx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html#installation) has a step by step guide on how to do it.

Migrating from Paperless-ng is easy, just drop in the new docker image! See the [documentation on migrating](https://paperless-ngx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html#migrating-from-paperless-ng) for more details.

# Affiliated Projects

Paperless has been around a while now, and people are starting to build stuff on top of it. If you're one of those people, we can add your project to this list:

- [Paperless App](https://github.com/bauerj/paperless_app): An Android/iOS app for Paperless-ngx. Also works with the original Paperless and Paperless-ngx.
- [Paperless Share](https://github.com/qcasey/paperless_share). Share any files from your Android application with paperless. Very simple, but works with all of the mobile scanning apps out there that allow you to share scanned documents.
- [Scan to Paperless](https://github.com/sbrunner/scan-to-paperless): Scan and prepare (crop, deskew, OCR, ...) your documents for Paperless.

These projects also exist, but their status and compatibility with paperless-ngx is unknown.

- [paperless-cli](https://github.com/stgarf/paperless-cli): A golang command line binary to interact with a Paperless instance.

This project also exists, but needs updates to be compatible with paperless-ngx.

- [Paperless Desktop](https://github.com/thomasbrueggemann/paperless-desktop): A desktop UI for your Paperless installation. Runs on Mac, Linux, and Windows.
  Known issues on Mac: (Could not load reminders and documents)

# Important Note

Document scanners are typically used to scan sensitive documents. Things like your social insurance number, tax records, invoices, etc. Everything is stored in the clear without encryption. This means that Paperless should never be run on an untrusted host. Instead, I recommend that if you do want to use it, run it locally on a server in your own home.
